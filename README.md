# Sales & Employee Analytics Dashboard – PT Bhinneka Group
This project simulates a real business request from top management at PT Bhinneka Group.

As a Data Analyst, I was asked to support the Head of Sales Operations & Capability who needed clear and reliable insights for a strategic meeting with the Managing Director Indonesia within 2 days. The challenge was not only to build dashboards, but also to:
- Understand urgent business needs
- Translate management questions into data analysis
- Deliver insights in a clear, simple, and decision-ready format

## Business Context 
PT Bhinneka Group operates:
- 2 business accounts: PT Bhinneka Stationary & PT Bhinneka Toys and Gaming

- Multiple product categories (stationery, gaming, accessories)
- An employee encentive scheme based on performance and attendance

The datasets include:
- Sales transaction data
- product & category data
- Outlet data
- Employee, attendance, and incentive data

## Business Questions
I was asked to answer the following key questions:

### 1. What is the total sales of One Piece themed products?
Business purpose:
- Evaluate performance of licensed-theme products
- Decide whether the One Piece theme should be expanded
Analytical approach:
- Filter product names containing One Piece keywords
- Aggregate total sales value

### 2. How much incentive does each employee receive?
Business purpose:
- Ensure performance transparency
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the incentive system
Analytical approach:
- Combine sales, attendance, and discipline data
- Calculate incentives based on company rules
- Compare employees who achieved targets vs did not

### 3. What is the total sales of Gaming Headset and Keyboard Gaming categories at Summarecon and AEON outlets?
Business purpose:
- Compare performance between strategic outlets
- Support stock allocation and promotion decisions
Analytical approach:

- Compare total sales by outlet

## How I Approach the Problem
In this project, I followed a structured analytical process:
1. Understand the business goal → What decisions will management make based on this data?
2. Translate questions into data logic → Filtering, grouping, and aggregation aligned with the questions
3. Validate the data → Ensure consistency across products, outlets, and employees
4. Design dashboards for fast decision-making → Focus on key KPIs, trends, and comparisons
